My Blog: A Dynamic Site with a Modern Look
My First Blog with Jinja and Bootstrap

This is a personal milestone where I built a full-featured blog that combines the power of a backend framework with a modern front-end library. I used Flask to create the web server, Jinja to handle dynamic content, and Bootstrap to give it a professional and responsive design. This project was a great way to put all my web development skills together and create a functional website.

How It Works

Flask: I used the Flask framework to set up a web server. It handles the routing and the logic for the blog, making it easy to manage different pages and content.

Jinja2 Templating: I used Jinja2 to create a single HTML template for the blog posts. This allowed me to display multiple blog posts dynamically from a list of data, which is a much more efficient way to build a website.

Bootstrap: I used the Bootstrap framework to add a lot of functionality and styling to my website without having to write a lot of custom CSS. This allowed me to create a professional-looking website quickly and efficiently.

Routing: I used Flask's routing decorators to handle different web requests, such as displaying the main blog page and a specific page for each blog post.
