Treasure Island: A Basic Treasure Hunt


How It Operates

This project serves as an excellent demonstration of several core Python ideas that come together to form a straightforward game:

Storytelling: The game presents your options and tells the story using print(). It then records your choices using input().

The Power of Choices: If, elif, and else statements form the foundation of the entire game. These conditional checks determine your course of action and the results you obtain.
