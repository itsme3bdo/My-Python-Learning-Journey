Rock, Paper, Scissors

This is a simple console game that lets you play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. It's a quick and fun way to test your luck and see if you can outsmart a randomly-generated opponent.

What's Happening in the Code

The script uses Python's random module to make the computer's choice. It then uses conditional logic (if/elif/else) to compare your move to the computer's and figure out who won. Finally, f-strings are used to display the result neatly in your terminal.
