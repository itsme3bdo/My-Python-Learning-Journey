Your Personal Python Calculator

This simple calculator runs right in your terminal, handling all the basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. A neat feature is that it lets you continue a calculation using your previous result, so you don't have to re-enter it every time.

How It Works

This project is a great way to see how a few key Python concepts work together to create a practical tool:

Functions and Dictionaries: The heart of the program is how it uses separate functions for each math operation (add, subtract, etc.). It then stores these functions in a dictionary, which is a clever way to let your choice of operator call the correct function automatically.

Loops: The while loop is what keeps the calculator running, letting you perform multiple calculations in a row. It also enables the cool feature of continuing with your previous answer.

User Input: The input() function is used to get the numbers and the operator you want to use.
