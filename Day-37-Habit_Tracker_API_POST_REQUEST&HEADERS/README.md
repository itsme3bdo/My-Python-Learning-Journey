Habit Tracker

This project is a practical application that helps you track your daily habits and build positive routines. It's a great way to use APIs and HTTP requests to keep a log of your progress, giving you a clear view of your journey toward a new, better habit.

How It Works 

This project is a showcase of how Python can connect to external services and manage data:

APIs: The program uses a public API, a web address that lets you create, update, and manage your habit tracking data online.

HTTP POST Requests: The project uses HTTP POST requests to send your habit-tracking data to the API. This is the same method that a web browser uses to send form data to a server.

Headers: The project uses HTTP headers to send important information along with its requests, such as your authentication token. This ensures that only you can access and modify your data.

Environment Variables: The program uses environment variables to securely store sensitive information like your API keys and authentication tokens. This is a crucial practice for keeping your credentials safe and out of your code.
