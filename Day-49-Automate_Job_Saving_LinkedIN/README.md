Automated Job Saver on LinkedIn

I built to automatically save job postings from LinkedIn based on my specific criteria. This project showcases my skills in web automation and demonstrates how to programmatically interact with complex websites. It's a great way to streamline a job search and make sure I don't miss out on any opportunities.

How It Works 

Selenium Webdriver: I used the selenium library to programmatically control a web browser. This allowed my Python script to open a specific URL, log in to my LinkedIn account, and navigate to the job search page.

Web Automation: The bot is programmed to simulate human actions, such as scrolling through a list of job postings, clicking on a job to view its details, and saving the ones that meet my criteria.

Dynamic Data Handling: I learned how to use a combination of Selenium and browser developer tools to find the unique IDs, classes, or XPaths of elements on the page, even when the content is dynamic. This allowed the script to reliably interact with the website's interface.
