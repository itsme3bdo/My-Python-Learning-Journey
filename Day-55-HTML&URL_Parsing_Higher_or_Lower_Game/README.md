Higher or Lower Game

This project is a fun and interactive web game that I built to practice my skills in web development. The game, "Higher or Lower," challenges me to guess a secret number by telling me if my guess is too high or too low. This project was a great way for me to learn how to create a simple, stateful web application that responds to user input.

How It Works 

This project is a showcase of the core concepts of web development that I learned:

Flask: I used the Flask micro-framework to build the web server and handle all the requests and responses. It's lightweight and makes it easy to create a functional web application.

HTML and URL Parsing: I learned how to serve an HTML page with instructions for the game. The game logic relies on parsing the URL to get the number I am guessing, a great way to handle user input without using forms.

Conditional Logic: The game's logic is built on conditional statements. These statements check if my guess is higher, lower, or equal to the secret number and then serve the correct response.

Random Numbers: I used Python's random module to generate a secret number, which ensures the game is different every time I play.
