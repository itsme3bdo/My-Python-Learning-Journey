Ping Pong Game 2 Players

This project is a digital recreation of the classic arcade game, Ping Pong. You and a friend will each control a paddle to hit a moving ball back and forth, trying to score points by getting it past your opponent. It's a great example of how to build a two-player game with Python.

How It Works

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The game is built using a clean, object-oriented approach. You'll find separate classes for the Paddle, Ball, and Scoreboard, which helps keep the code organized and easy to manage.

The turtle Module: The game's visuals are all handled by the turtle library. It's used to draw the paddles, the ball, and the scoreboard on the screen.

Game Loop and Animation: The game uses a continuous while loop that constantly updates the screen, making the paddles and the ball appear to move smoothly.

Control and Collision Detection: The code listens for keyboard input to let you and your opponent control the paddles. The game also includes logic to detect when the ball has collided with a wall or a paddle, changing its direction and updating the score when necessary.
