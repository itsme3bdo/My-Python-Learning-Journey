Number Guessing Game

This is a classic guessing game that runs right in your terminal. The computer will pick a secret number between 1 and 100, and it's your job to guess what it is. You can choose between two difficulty levels: "Easy" for more guesses or "Hard" for a bigger challenge.

How It Works

Functions: The game is neatly organized with a few different functions that handle different parts of the logic, like choosing the difficulty, checking your guess, and running the main game loop.

Randomness: The random module is used to pick the secret number, making every game a unique experience.

Loops: A while loop keeps the game going round after round, letting you guess until you either win or run out of attempts.

Conditional Logic: if/elif/else statements are at the heart of the game, letting you know if your guess was too high or too low, and celebrating when you get it just right.
