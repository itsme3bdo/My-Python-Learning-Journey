Selenium Webdriver Game-Playing Bot

This is a fun and challenging project where I created a bot to automatically play a game in a web browser. I built this to showcase my skills in web automation and to demonstrate how powerful tools like Selenium Webdriver can be. The bot can navigate to a website, identify game elements, and interact with the game just as a human would.

How It Works 

This project is a showcase of the core concepts of web automation that I learned:

Selenium Webdriver: I used the selenium library to programmatically control a web browser. This allowed my Python script to open a specific URL, click on elements, and simulate keyboard presses.

Inspecting HTML: I learned how to use my browser's developer tools to inspect the HTML of the game and find the unique IDs, classes, or XPaths of the game elements I needed to interact with.

Automation and Control: The program runs a script that automatically plays the game by checking the game state, making a decision, and then taking an action.
