Higher or Lower

This is a fun command-line game that pits two famous people or entities against each other. Your job is to guess which one has more followers. With each correct guess, your score goes up, but one wrong answer and the game is over!

How It Works

Dictionaries and Lists: The game uses a list of dictionaries to store all the data, with each dictionary containing information about a person or entity (name, description, country, and follower count).

Functions: The core logic is built using functions, which keeps the code clean and easy to read.

Randomness: The random module is the engine of the game, choosing a new set of opponents for each round.

Loops: A while loop keeps the game going as long as you keep guessing correctly.

Conditional Logic: The heart of the game is the if and elif statements that compare the follower counts and determine if your guess was right or wrong.
