Turtle Crossing Game

This is a fun and challenging game where you guide a small turtle across a busy, multi-lane highway without getting hit by cars. With each successful crossing, you'll earn a point and the game will get a little bit harder. It's a great example of a classic arcade-style game built with Python.

How It Works

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The game is built using a clean, object-oriented approach. You'll find separate classes for the Player, the CarManager (to handle all the moving cars), and the Scoreboard, which helps keep the code organized and easy to manage.

The turtle Module: The game's visuals are all handled by the turtle library. It's used to draw the player, the cars, and the scoreboard on the screen.

Game Loop and Animation: The game uses a continuous while loop that constantly updates the screen, making the turtle and the cars appear to move smoothly.

Control and Collision Detection: The code listens for keyboard input to let you move the turtle. The game also includes logic to detect when the turtle has collided with a car, which ends the game. It also checks when you've reached the other side to advance you to the next level.
