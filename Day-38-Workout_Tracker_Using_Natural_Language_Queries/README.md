Workout Tracker
Track Your Workouts with Natural Language

This is a powerful and practical application that helps you track your workouts and stay in shape. What makes this project special is that you can log your exercises in plain, natural language, and the app will automatically understand and save your data. It's a great way to use APIs and AI to create a seamless user experience.

How It Works

This project is a fantastic showcase of how a few key Python concepts work together to create a seamless and intelligent application:

Natural Language Processing (NLP) with APIs: The core of this program uses an API (Application Programming Interface) that understands natural language. This means you can type a sentence like "I ran for 30 minutes and did 10 push-ups," and the API will parse the data and give you a structured response.

Working with Environment Variables: The program uses environment variables to securely store sensitive information like your API keys and authentication tokens. This is a crucial practice for keeping your credentials safe and out of your code.

HTTP POST Requests: The project uses HTTP POST requests to send your workout data to the API. This is the same method that a web browser uses to send form data to a server.

Putting It All Together: The program takes the structured data from the NLP API and then sends it to a second API, like Google Sheets, to keep a log of your progress. This is a great example of how to chain multiple APIs together to build a powerful application.
