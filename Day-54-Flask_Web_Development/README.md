Flask Web Development
My First Web Server with Flask

This project is a personal milestone where I built my very first web server using the Flask micro-framework. It's a great example of how to use Python to create a simple, functional website. I've learned how to handle web requests, set up different routes, and serve HTML pages to a user.

How It Works

This project is a showcase of the core concepts of web development that I learned:

Flask: I used the Flask framework to set up a basic web server. It's lightweight and makes it easy to get a web application up and running quickly.

Routing: I learned how to use decorators like @app.route('/') to tell my server which function to run when a user visits a specific URL.

HTML Rendering: I learned how to serve a static HTML file to the user when they visit the home page.
