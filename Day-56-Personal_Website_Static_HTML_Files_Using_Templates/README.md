Personal Website

This is a personal milestone where I built my very first personal website using Flask and Jinja2 templates. The goal of this project was to create a clean, static website that could serve as a portfolio or a personal blog. I learned how to separate the presentation (the HTML) from the application logic, which is a key concept in web development.

How It Works

Flask: I used the Flask framework to set up a basic web server. It's lightweight and makes it easy to get a web application up and running quickly.

Templates: The project uses Jinja2 templating. This allowed me to create a reusable HTML layout and then insert specific content into it, which is much more efficient than writing a new HTML file for every page.

Static Files: I learned how to serve static files like CSS stylesheets and images. This is essential for adding design and visual elements to a web page.

Routing: I used decorators like @app.route('/') to handle different web requests and serve the correct HTML pages to a user.
