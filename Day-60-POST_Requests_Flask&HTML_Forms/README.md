Handling User Input with Flask
My First Web App with Forms

This is a personal milestone where I built a simple web application that can receive and process user data from a web form. The goal was to create a basic web server using Flask and then build an HTML form that uses a POST request to send data back to the server. It's a fundamental step in building any kind of interactive website, from a simple contact form to a social media platform.

How It Works

Flask Web Server: I used the Flask framework to create a basic web server. It handles incoming web requests and sends back the appropriate responses.

HTML Forms: I built a simple HTML page with a <form> element. This is the part of the website where users can enter their data and submit it.

POST Requests: I learned the difference between GET and POST requests. In this project, the form uses a POST request to securely send the user's data to the server without it being visible in the URL.

Routing and Request Handling: I set up Flask to handle different routes for the same URL. One route is for displaying the HTML form (using a GET request), and the other is for processing the data sent from that form (using a POST request).
