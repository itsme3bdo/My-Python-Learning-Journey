Errors, Exceptions & JSON Data

This project is a showcase of two crucial skills for any developer: handling unexpected errors gracefully and working with JSON, a common data format for storing and exchanging information. By understanding these concepts, you can build applications that are both reliable and capable of saving and retrieving data.

How It Works 

This project is an example of how a few key Python concepts work together to create a practical and resilient application:

Handling Errors with try-except: The project uses try-except blocks to anticipate and handle potential problems in the code. This prevents the program from crashing and allows you to provide a friendly message to the user when something unexpected happens.

Working with JSON: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format for storing and exchanging data. This project shows you how to use Python's built-in json module to read, write, and manipulate data stored in a JSON file.
