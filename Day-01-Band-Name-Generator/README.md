A Fun Little Band Name Creator

How It Works

This project is a great example of a few basic Python building blocks. The code does a few key things:

It uses the input() function to get some information from youâ€”specifically, the city you grew up in and your pet's name.

It then takes those two answers and uses string concatenation to join them together.

Finally, it uses the print() function to show you your brand new band name right there in the console.
