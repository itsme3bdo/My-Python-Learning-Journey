Turtle & GUI
First Steps into Graphical Programming

This project is your introduction to creating graphics and simple user interfaces (GUIs) in Python. Instead of just seeing text in your terminal, you'll be able to create shapes, lines, and more. It's a great way to make code come alive visually.

How It Works 

This project is a showcase of two core concepts:

The turtle Module: Python's built-in turtle module is your virtual drawing pen. You'll create a Turtle object, which you can then command to move, change color, and draw lines on a Screen object. This is a classic and fun way to learn the fundamentals of graphics programming.

Events and User Interaction: The turtle module also allows for basic user interaction. You can program the screen to listen for a mouse click, which is a key concept in GUI development.
