NATO Phonetic Alphabet

This is a neat little program that translates any word you type into the NATO phonetic alphabet. It's a great way to understand how to use Python to work with data and create a practical tool that you can use to spell out words clearly over the phone or radio.

How It Works

Working with Data: The program uses the pandas library to read all the NATO phonetic alphabet data from a CSV file. This is a very common way to handle structured data in Python.

List Comprehension: The core of the program uses a powerful and concise Python feature called list comprehension. This allows the code to process each letter of your word and quickly create a new list of the corresponding phonetic codes.

Dictionaries: The data from the CSV file is converted into a dictionary, which is an incredibly fast way to look up the phonetic code for each letter.
