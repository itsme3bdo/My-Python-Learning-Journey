Make Your Data Look Great

This little script is all about making your data easy to read and visually appealing. It uses the PrettyTable library to take a simple list of information and turn it into a beautiful, well-organized table right in your terminal. It's a great way to display things like lists of items, scores, or any kind of structured data.

How It Works 

This project is a showcase of how external Python libraries can simplify complex tasks.

Importing a Library: The very first step is to import the PrettyTable class from the library. This gives you all the tools you need to create a table.

Creating a Table: It then creates a new table object, which is like a blank canvas for your data.

Adding Your Data: The add_column() method is used to add data to the table. You simply provide a column heading and a list of the data for that column.

Formatting: The table.align property is a great way to control how the content in your columns is aligned, making it easy to create a polished look.
