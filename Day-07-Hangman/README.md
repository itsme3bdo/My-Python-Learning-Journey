Hangman Game

This is a command-line game where you have to guess the secret word one letter at a time. 

How It Works

This project is a great way to see how a few key Python concepts come together to create an interactive game:

Random Words: The game uses the random module to pick a secret word for you to guess.

Game Logic: The game's core logic is built on loops (while) and conditional statements (if/elif/else). These check for correct guesses, update the word display, and keep track of your remaining lives.

Visuals: The game imports art assets to display the hangman stages, which makes the game more visually engaging.

Lists: We use a list to store and display the current progress of the word you're trying to guess.
