Automated Tinder Swiping

This project showcases my skills in web automation and demonstrates how to programmatically interact with a complex website. It's a great way to streamline a dating search and save myself a lot of time.

How It Works 

This project is a showcase of the core concepts of web automation that I learned:

Selenium Webdriver: I used the selenium library to programmatically control a web browser. This allowed my Python script to open a specific URL, log in to my Tinder account, and navigate through profiles.

Web Automation: The bot is programmed to simulate human actions, such as clicking on a button to swipe right or left.

Dynamic Data Handling: I learned how to use a combination of Selenium and browser developer tools to find the unique IDs, classes, or XPaths of elements on the page, even when the content is dynamic. This allowed the script to reliably interact with the website's interface.
