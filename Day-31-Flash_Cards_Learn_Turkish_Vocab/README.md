Flash Cards: Learn Turkish Vocabulary

This flashcard app is a fun and effective way to build vocabulary. The app shows you a Turkish word, and you have to try and remember its English translation. If you get it right, the app moves on to a new word. If you get it wrong, it gives you the correct answer and lets you try again.

How It Works

This project is a showcase of how a few key Python concepts work together to create an interactive learning tool:

Tkinter: The app's entire visual layout—including the flashcards, text, and buttons—is built using Tkinter, Python's standard library for creating Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).

Working with Data: The app uses the pandas library to read and manage all the Turkish and English vocabulary from a CSV file. This is a very common way to handle structured data in Python.

Randomness and Loops: The app uses the random module to select a word at random, and a while loop keeps the game going until you've learned all the words.

JSON: The app uses the json module to save and retrieve your learning progress, so you can pick up where you left off.
