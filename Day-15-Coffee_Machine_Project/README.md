Coffee Machine

ThIt's designed to act like a real coffee machine, letting you order different types of coffee while keeping track of its own resources like water, milk, and coffee beans.

How It Works

This project is a showcase of how nested dictionaries in Python can be used to model complex data in a structured way.

Menu and Resources: The program uses two main dictionaries: MENU and resources. MENU stores all the details for each coffee, including the ingredients and cost. The resources dictionary keeps a running count of how much water, milk, and coffee are available.

Logical Operations: The script uses a series of conditional checks to make sure your order can be fulfilled. It will check if there are enough ingredients to make your drink and will also handle the transaction, giving you change if you need it.

Simple State Management: As you make more drinks, the program updates the resources dictionary to reflect the ingredients used.
