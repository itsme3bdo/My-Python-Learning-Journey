Internet Speed Twitter Complaint Bot

I built to automatically check my internet speed and, if it's too slow, tweet a complaint to my internet service provider. This project showcases my skills in web automation and demonstrates how to use code to solve a real-world problem.

How It Works

This project is a showcase of the concepts of web automation that I learned:

Selenium Webdriver: I used the selenium library to programmatically control a web browser. This allowed my Python script to open a speed test website, run the test, and then navigate to Twitter to log in and create a new tweet.

Web Automation: The bot is programmed to simulate human actions, such as clicking buttons, waiting for the test to finish, and entering text into a tweet.

Conditional Logic: The script checks if my internet speed is slower than what I'm paying for. If it is, the bot is programmed to automatically send a tweet with the relevant information.

Environment Variables: I learned how to use environment variables to securely store sensitive information like my internet provider's Twitter handle, my internet speed goal, and my Twitter login credentials.
