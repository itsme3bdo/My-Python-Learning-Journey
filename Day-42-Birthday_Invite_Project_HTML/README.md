Birthday Invite Project

This project is a simple web page that I built using HTML. The goal is to create a birthday invitation with an image of a birthday cake, a list of what to bring, and a link to the location.

How It Works

This project is a showcase of the core building blocks of HTML:

Headings: I used different heading tags (like <h1>, <h2>, and <h3>) to organize your page and give it a clear structure.

Images: I learned how to add images to your page using the <img> tag and how to use the src attribute to specify the image's location.

Paragraphs and Lists: I used <p> and <li> tags to add text and create an ordered list for your movie rankings.
