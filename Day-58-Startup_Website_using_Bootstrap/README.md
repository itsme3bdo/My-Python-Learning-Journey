Startup Website using Bootstrap
My First Website with a Modern Framework

This is a personal milestone where I built my very first website using the Bootstrap framework. The goal of this project was to create a responsive, modern-looking website for a fictional startup. I learned how to use a front-end framework to quickly build a professional-looking website without having to write a lot of custom CSS.

How It Works

Bootstrap: I used the Bootstrap framework to add a lot of functionality and styling to my website without having to write a lot of code. This allowed me to create a professional-looking website quickly and efficiently.

HTML Structure: I used HTML to create the basic structure of the web page, including the <h1>, <p>, and <img> tags to add a heading, a paragraph, and an image to the page.

Responsive Design: The website is designed to be fully responsive, which means it looks great on all devices, from a desktop computer to a mobile phone. This is a key concept in modern web design.
