CSV Country Game
A Quiz to Test Your Knowledge of Countries and Their States

This is a simple but fun quiz game that challenges you to name all the states within a specific country. The game will show you a map of the country, and your goal is to type in the name of each state correctly. It's a great way to learn more about the world while practicing your Python skills.

How It Works 

This project is a showcase of how Python can work with external data to create an interactive experience:

Working with CSV Files: The game gets all its data (the names and locations of the states) from a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file. This is a very common way to store and share data, and the project shows you how to read this data and use it in your program.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): The game uses the turtle library to display a map of the country and to place the names of the states you have correctly guessed on the map.

Event Handling: The program is always listening for your input, and when you type in a guess, it processes it to see if you were right.

Conditional Logic: The game uses a series of if and else statements to check if your guess is correct, update your score, and tell you if you've won or lost.
