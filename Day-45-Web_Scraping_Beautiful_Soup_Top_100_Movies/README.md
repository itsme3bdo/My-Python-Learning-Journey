Web Scraping Beautiful Soup Top 100 Movies
My First attempt into Web Scraping

This project is a personal milestone where I learned how to "scrape" data from a website. I used Python to automatically pull a list of the top 100 movies from a web page. This is a powerful skill that allows me to programmatically gather information from the internet and use it in my own applications.

How It Works 

This project is a showcase of the core concepts of web scraping that I learned:

HTTP Requests: I used the requests library to send an HTTP request to the web page and get its full HTML content.

Beautiful Soup: The core of this project uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse the raw HTML and turn it into a structured object that I can navigate and search through easily.

Inspecting HTML: I learned how to use my browser's developer tools to inspect the HTML and find the specific tags and attributes that contained the movie titles.
