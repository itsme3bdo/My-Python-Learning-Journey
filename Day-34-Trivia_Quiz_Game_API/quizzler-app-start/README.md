Trivia Quiz Game


This is a fun and interactive trivia game that uses questions from a real online database. You'll be presented with a question and have to guess if the answer is "True" or "False." The game keeps track of your score and keeps going until you've answered all the questions. It's a great way to learn new facts while having fun.

How It Works 

This project is a showcase of how a few key Python concepts work together to create a dynamic and interactive game:

APIs: The program makes a request to a public API, a web address that gives you live data with trivia questions.

Classes and Objects: The game is built using a clean, object-oriented approach. There are separate classes for the Question, QuizBrain, and UI (user interface), which helps keep the code organized and easy to manage.

Tkinter: The app's entire visual layout—including the question text, score, and buttons—is built using Tkinter, Python's standard library for creating Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).

Event Handling: The program is designed to listen for user actions, such as clicking the "True" or "False" buttons, which trigger a new question and update your score.
