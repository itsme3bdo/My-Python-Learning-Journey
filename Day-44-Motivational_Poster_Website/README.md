Motivational Poster Website
My First Combination of HTML and CSS

This project is a simple but fun website that I built to combine my HTML and CSS skills. The goal was to create a motivational poster with an image and a quote to showcase what I have learned about web design.

How It Works

This project is a showcase of the core building blocks of HTML and CSS that I learned:

HTML Structure: I used HTML to create the basic structure of the web page, including the <h1>, <p>, and <img> tags to add a heading, a paragraph, and an image to the page.

CSS Styling: I used CSS to style the web page, including adding a background color, changing the fonts, and centering the content on the page.

Fonts: I used the font-family property to change the fonts and make the text look more visually appealing.
