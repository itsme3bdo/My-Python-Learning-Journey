Password Manager

This is a simple desktop application that helps you securely generate and save passwords for all your online accounts. Instead of trying to remember dozens of complex passwords, you can use this tool to create strong, random passwords and store them safely.

How It Work

Tkinter: This is Python's standard library for creating Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). The app's entire visual layout—including the buttons, text fields, and the window itself—is built using Tkinter.

Working with Files: The program uses Python's file handling capabilities to securely store and retrieve your saved passwords in a text file.

Randomness: The program uses Python's random module to generate a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols for a strong and secure password.
