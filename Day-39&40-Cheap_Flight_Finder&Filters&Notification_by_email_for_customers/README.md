Cheap Flight Finder

This is a powerful and practical application that helps you find the best deals on flights and notifies you when prices drop. It's a great example of how to use APIs and automation to save money and time when you're planning your next trip.

How It Works 

APIs: The core of this program uses a flight search API (Application Programming Interface) to get live flight data, including prices, airlines, and dates.

Working with Files: The program reads a list of destinations and their corresponding airport codes from a CSV file, so you can easily manage and update your list of destinations.

Filters and Logic: The project uses conditional logic to filter through all the available flights and find the ones that meet your criteria. For example, it might only show you flights that are cheaper than a certain price or within a specific date range.

SMTP: The program uses SMTP to send you an email notification when it finds a cheap flight. This is the same protocol that a web browser uses to send an email.
