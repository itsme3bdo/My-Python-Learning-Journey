Automated Amazon Price Tracker

This is a powerful and practical application that I built to automatically track the price of an item on Amazon. It's a great example of how I can use web scraping and automation to save money on my purchases. All I have to do is set a target price for an item, and the program will send me a notification when the price drops.

How It Works 

This project is a showcase of the core concepts of web scraping and automation that I learned:

Web Scraping: I used the requests library to fetch the HTML content of a specific Amazon product page and then used Beautiful Soup to parse the raw data and find the item's current price.

Automation: The program runs a script that automatically checks the price of the item at regular intervals.

Conditional Logic: I used conditional statements to check if the current price is less than my target price. If it is, the program sends a notification.

SMTP: I used SMTP to send myself an email notification when the price of the item drops. This is the same protocol that a web browser uses to send an email.
