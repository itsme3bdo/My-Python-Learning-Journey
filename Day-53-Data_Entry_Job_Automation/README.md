Data Entry Job Automation

This is a powerful and practical application that I built to automate a tedious data entry task. This project showcases my skills in web scraping and web automation, demonstrating how I can programmatically gather information from one source and then use it to fill out a form on another website. It's a great example of using code to save time and streamline a repetitive process.

How It Works 

This project is a showcase of the concepts of web scraping and automation that I learned:

Web Scraping: I used the BeautifulSoup library to parse the raw HTML of a web page and extract specific data points, such as addresses, prices, and links.

Web Automation: I used the selenium library to programmatically control a web browser. This allowed my Python script to navigate to a specific website, find the input fields of a form, and then automatically enter the scraped data.

Dynamic Data Handling: I learned how to handle the data I scraped, storing it in a structured way (like a list of dictionaries) and then iterating through it to fill out the form for each entry.
