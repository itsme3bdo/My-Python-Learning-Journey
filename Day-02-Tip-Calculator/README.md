Tip Calculator Project

Just enter the total bill, the tip percentage you want to give, and how many people are splitting, and it instantly tells you exactly how much each person needs to pay.

How It Works

This project is a fantastic way to practice some basic but essential Python skills:

Input from the user: It uses the input() function to gather all the necessary numbers from you.

Data types: The script handles different types of data, like converting the bill to a float (so it can have decimal points) and the tip percentage and number of people to int (whole numbers).

Math and formatting: It does a bit of simple math to figure out the final amount. It also uses an f-string and the round() function to make sure the final amount is a clean number with two decimal places, just like you'd see on a real bill.
