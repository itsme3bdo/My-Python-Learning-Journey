PyPassword Generator
A Simple Tool for Creating Strong Passwords

It's a command-line script that asks you how many letters, symbols, and numbers you want, and then generates a secure, random password for you in seconds.

How It Works

The script uses Python's random module to create a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols based on your input. It then shuffles everything around to make sure the password is unpredictable and random.
