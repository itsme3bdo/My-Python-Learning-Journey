Snake Game

This project is a recreation of the classic arcade game, Snake. You'll control a snake, guiding it around the screen to eat food and grow longer, all while trying to avoid hitting the walls or your own tail. It's a great example of how to build an interactive, animated game with Python.

How It Works

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The game is built using a clean, object-oriented approach. You'll find separate classes for the Snake, Food, and Scoreboard, which helps keep the code organized and easy to manage.

The turtle Module: The game's visuals are all handled by the turtle library. It's used to draw the snake segments, the food, and the scoreboard text on the screen.

Animation and Control: The game uses a continuous while loop that constantly updates the screen, making the snake appear to move smoothly. The code also listens for keyboard input (like the arrow keys) to let you control the snake's direction.

Collision Detection: The game includes logic to detect when the snake has either collided with the wall or its own tail, which ends the game and displays your final score.
