Day-61-Flask-WTForms

This repository contains the project for Day 61 of "My Python Learning Journey," focusing on Flask-WTForms. This project demonstrates the implementation of web forms in a Flask application using the powerful WTForms library.

Features:

Form Creation: Defines a registration form using WTForms with fields for email, password, and submit.

Validation: Utilizes built-in WTForms validators to ensure data integrity, such as DataRequired for mandatory fields and Email for proper email format.

Rendering: Renders the form on the webpage using Jinja2 templates.

Handling Form Submissions: Processes the submitted form data on the server side and handles validation errors.
