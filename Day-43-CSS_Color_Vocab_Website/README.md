CSS Color Vocab Website
My First Web Page with Styling

This is a simple web page that I built to practice my CSS skills. It's a great example of how to use CSS to add colors, change fonts, and make a web page look more visually appealing. The goal was to create a list of different colors and their names, each with a different background color and font, so I could get a feel for how to style a web page.

How It Works

This project is a showcase of the core building blocks of CSS that I learned:

Internal CSS: I used internal CSS within the <style> tag to add all the styling to the page.

Colors: I learned how to use different color properties, like color, background-color, and border-color, to add colors to my page.

Fonts: I used the font-family and font-size properties to change the fonts and make the text look more visually appealing.
