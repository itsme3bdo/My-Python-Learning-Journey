Pomodoro App

This is a functional app that helps you stay focused and productive using the popular Pomodoro Technique. It provides a simple timer with work sessions and break periods, giving you a clear visual cue for when it's time to focus and when to rest.

How It Works

This project is a showcase of how a few key Python concepts work together to create a practical desktop application:

Tkinter: This is Python's standard library for creating Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). The app's entire visual layout—including the timer, buttons, and text—is built using Tkinter.

Dynamic Updating: The app uses a function that dynamically updates the timer on the screen every second. It's a great example of how to make your GUI elements change in real-time without having to restart the program.

Event Handling: The program is designed to listen for user actions, such as clicking the "Start," "Reset," or "Pause" buttons. These events trigger specific functions that control the timer's behavior.
