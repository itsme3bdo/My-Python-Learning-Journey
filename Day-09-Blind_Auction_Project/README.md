Blind Auction

This is a fun and simple program that runs a blind auction right from your terminal. The program will collect all the bids and then, at the end, it will automatically reveal who the winner is.

How It Works

This project is a showcase of a few fundamental Python concepts that work together to create a practical application:

Dictionaries: The program uses a dictionary to store all the bids. The bidder's name is the key, and their bid amount is the value.

Functions: There's a special function, find_highest(), which takes the dictionary of bids and goes through it to figure out who submitted the highest bid.

Loops: The program uses a while loop to keep the auction open, asking for new bids until you're ready to stop.

Making it a "Blind" Auction: When a new person is ready to bid, the program clears the screen. This is a neat trick that keeps each bidder's amount a secret from the next person!
