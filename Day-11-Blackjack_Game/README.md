Blackjack

This is a fun and simple command-line version of the classic card game Blackjack. You'll play against the computer, trying to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. It's a great way to experience the game's core logic and decision making, all from your terminal.

How It Works

This project is a showcase of a few fundamental Python concepts that work together to create an interactive game:

Randomness: The random module is used to deal cards from a "deck" to both you and the computer, ensuring a different game every time.

Functions: The core of the game is a function, calculate_score(), which figures out the value of a hand. It's even smart enough to handle the tricky rules for the Ace card!

Loops: The game uses while loops to keep the game going as long as you want to play, and to let you decide whether to take another card or pass your turn.

Lists: Your cards and the computer's cards are stored in lists, which allows the game to add new cards to your hand as you play.
