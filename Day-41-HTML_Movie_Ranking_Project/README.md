HTML Movie Ranking Project
First Web Page: A Personalized Movie List

Welcome to my first step into web development! This project is a simple but fun web page that you'll build using HTML. The goal is to create a list of your favorite movies, ranked in order, complete with images and a short description. It's a great way to learn the foundational elements of web design and get a feel for how web pages are structured.

How It Works

This project is a showcase of the core building blocks of HTML:

Headings: You'll use different heading tags (like <h1>, <h2>, and <h3>) to organize your page and give it a clear structure.

Images: You'll learn how to add images to your page using the <img> tag and how to use the src attribute to specify the image's location.

Paragraphs and Lists: You'll use <p> and <li> tags to add text and create an ordered list for your movie rankings.
