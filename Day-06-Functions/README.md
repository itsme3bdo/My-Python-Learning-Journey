My First Python Function

This is a great little script that shows you the very basics of how functions work in Python. It's a fundamental concept that every programmer needs to know, and this example makes it super easy to understand.

How It Works

This project is a perfect way to grasp two key concepts:

Defining a Function: The def keyword is used to create a new function called my_function().

Calling a Function: The lines of code inside the function (print("Hello") and print("Bye")) only run when you call the function by its name, as seen with my_function() at the end of the script.
