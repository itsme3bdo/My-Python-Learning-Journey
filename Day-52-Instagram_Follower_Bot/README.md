Instagram Follower Bot

This is a powerful and practical application that I built to automate the process of following accounts on Instagram. I created this project to showcase my skills in web automation and demonstrate how to programmatically interact with a dynamic and complex website. It's a great example of how to use code to save time and streamline a repetitive task.

How It Works

Selenium Webdriver: I used the selenium library to programmatically control a web browser. This allowed my Python script to open a specific URL, log in to my Instagram account, and navigate to different pages.

Web Automation: The bot is programmed to simulate human actions, such as scrolling through a list of profiles, clicking the "Follow" button, and handling dynamic pop-ups or alerts.

Dynamic Data Handling: I learned how to use a combination of Selenium and browser developer tools to find the unique IDs, classes, or XPaths of elements on the page, even when the content changes. This allowed the script to reliably interact with the website's interface.
